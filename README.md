# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient using Machine Learning techniques. The model is trained on the **COE-Heart Dataset** and implemented using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction can help in timely treatment and prevention. This project builds a classification model to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on medical attributes.
